	<h1>Security Assessment of Owen Martin's Marauder's Map</h1>
	1. Cross Site scripting
	2. Can add values that aren't numbers-- Show as NaN on log, and marker shows at 0 0 on map
		-also can add values that don't make sense (aka out of range of possible lat and long)
	3. Associative array injection on GET parameter-- can see all database entries
		-remediate by checking and neutralizing all get and post parameters

	-sidenote: had to change server to show on my local
	-had to change mmap line 97 from 
		student_list = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
	to
		student_list = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).students;
	to get the other people to show
	-also the marker doesn't seem to be showing the current location
