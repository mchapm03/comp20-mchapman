The purpose of this GitHub repository is hold the files for the projects completed as a part of comp20.

My favorite assignement was the second, the Marauder's Map client. I found it both interesting and satisfying to make a website that could show both my location and my classmate's locations. It was a great way to learn about interacting with API's and I could see some of the practical applications of this class material.

I have grown very much since day 1. I came into this class with some knowledge of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript. I had worked with Wordpress, but my knowledge was very superficial. Now, I feel very much more comfortble with javascript. More than this, though, I am understanding how a web server works and interacts with a database. Writing my own server was the biggest place of growth. I now feel that I can make much more realistic web applications!

The most important thing that I learned in this class was to not reinvent the wheel. Often, we make things more complicated by trying to code from scratch, when someone before us has already found a way to do something. For example, for our final project, we were going to try to do user validation ourselves, but have found that it will be much easier (and more secure) to use Google's API. The other thing is that you can NEVER TRUST THE USER. Any user input exposes an application to vulnerabilities such as database injection and cross site scripting. Even here, though, we can use encoding tools created by others to help solve many of these problems

I would love to start applying what I learned to mobile development.
