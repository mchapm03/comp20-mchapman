Messages.html creates a web page that parses the JSON data to display the messages from data.json.

This assignment took approximately 2 hours to complete.

It is not possible to request the data from a different origin for security reasons. According to the same origin policy the XMLHttpRequest only works if the two sites have the same uri scheme, hostname and port number. This policy is important so that one site's javascript can only modify that site's content. There are other ways to get json data from another site, such as JSONP.
