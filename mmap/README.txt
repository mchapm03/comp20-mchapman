All parts of Assignment 2 have been correctly implemented. Index.html creates a webpage that loads a map of the current user's location. This location is marked with a pachyderm icon. Additionally, the file posts the user's location data to https://secret-about-box.herokuapp.com/sendLocation. The request to https://secret-about-box.herokuapp.com/sendLocation returns data of other user's and their locations. The map can then display markers of other user's locations with a title of their name and distance from the user.
